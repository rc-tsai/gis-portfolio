This project attempts to identify bald eaglesâ€™ habitat in Georgia by looking for a natural environment that provides a suitable location and enough food sources. The criteria used for selecting a location are as follows.


## Suitability mode

The ordinal combination is used to evaluate the suitability of potential habitat for bald eagles in Georgia. I concatenated the layers to identify potential habitat. However, this is an intermediate result. The final result will be detailed, followed by the maps in the next few pages.
