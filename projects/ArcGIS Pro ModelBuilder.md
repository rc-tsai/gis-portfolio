In the majority of analyses concerning bike share demand, researchers employ a Euclidean buffer to examine the attractions surrounding bike stations. This method, however, may lead to biased results, despite the apparent similarity in coverage produced by both Euclidean and network distances. The following images illustrate the differences between Thiessen buffers using Euclidean and network distances.
