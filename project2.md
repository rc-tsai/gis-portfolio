    <span style="font-family: times new romans;">***Speakers*** </span>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The host and guest speakers have a diverse experiences in different expert fields. They have been working in the freight industry, planning field, and academia for many years. They are deeply engaged in Transportation Research Board, and National Academies and share expertise in maritime, freight industry, and transportation planning. They each provide valuable questions and profound perspectives throughout this interview.</span>
    
<span style="font-family: times new romans;">*Eric Shen*</span> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: times new romans;">Professor Shen, the host speaker, serves as the Director of Capital Projects and Chief Engineer in the San Gabriel Valley of Governments and is currently Price school faculty at the University of Southern California (USC). Professor Shen has great establishments in both the planning field and academia. Professor Shen is an expert in transportation engineering and capital projects. During Professor Shen’s time working at Port of Long Beach as the director of transportation planning, Mr. Shen secured full funding for the Gerald Desmond Bridge Replacement Project successfully funded through a multi-agency agreement. As an Adjunct Professor at USC Price planning school, Professor Shen leverages his freight transport and supply chain expertise in the Transportation Planning Studio course. As one of the few freight transport course providers in urban planning programs on the West Coast, Professor Shen has brought the freight industry to the fore in academia since 2008.</span>

<span style="font-family: times new romans;">*Paul Bingham*</span> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: times new romans;">Mr. Bingam studied economics and computer science. He carves out his entire career in economic consulting around transportation and trade from different positions in different companies. Mr. Bingham Currently serves as the Director, Transportation Consulting, at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. He also served decision-makers in government across the United States and industry globally with wide array of issues ranging from high level national policy issues to local metropolitan area planning, and provides wide range of services from global strategy to individual site selection such as market decisions for companies.</span>
    
<span style="font-family: times new romans;">***Context Overview***</span> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: times new romans;">This interview was structured as an informative between two speakers on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global supply chain disruptions but also considering the rippling effect of other major international affairs. The guest speaker's analytical responses were followed by the host speaker's urban planning perspective questions. Thought-provoking questions elicit the response to the following issues 1) US and Western Europe Economy, 2) China Emerging Economy, 3) Diversification of Supply Chain, 4) Trade Policy, and 5) Recession: Labelling or not. The dialogue between speakers, coupled with the supplemental material made by the guest speaker, thus provides an in-depth illustration of the global supply chain.</span>
    
<span style="font-family: times new romans;">***Key Points Offered by The Speakers***</span>
    <span style="font-family: times new romans;">*US and Western Europe Economy* </span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: times new romans;">Mr. Bingham notes that the state of the economy is still growing regarding the tremendous impact resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Recovery is strong partly because aided by the government in spending. The demand of categories of economic activity has not lesson by a negative impact on the global economy, especially goods demand. Today’s economy still accompanies the demand for certain categories of goods and commodities since 2020. However, the dire need for demand of goods and disruption in supply chains in 2020 that happened last time in history can be traced back to WWII. Such a tremendous impact on the global economy leads to transformative changes in behavior and attitudes that are likely to stick with us for decades in terms of the world economy. He keeps elaborating that although the COVID-19 pandemic claims people's lives across the globe, those people didn’t sacrifice for nothing. Being well-prepared in terms of personal protective equipment and needed supplies for the maintenance of public health is thus an important lesson we have learned from the pandemic. Next, jobs are still plentiful. This is another sign that the economy is still growing. The workforce is insufficient at any pay rate, which is to say, workers are in a relatively strong position in the labor market. The differential growth rate shows that the U.S. economy is stronger than the economies in Western Europe. First, the dislocation from the Russian invasion of Ukraine negatively impacts these economies, including termination of the trade between Russian and Western Europe economies due to the sanctions on Russia and the disruptions to traded market between Ukraine and Western Europe economies. The Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in a change in demand and caused a rippling effect and dire repercussions across the globe.</span>
    
<span style="font-family: times new romans;">*China Emerging Economy*</span> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: times new romans;">China benefits from joining the World Trade Organization by gaining more foreign investment. Foreign companies were willing to take the financial risk in China market not because China was a big economy but being the largest population country in the world and the low-cost labor in China. However, they are not the independent contributing factors to China’s booming economy, China’s government played an active role in engaging in policies that enabled and supported Chinese companies, referred to as state-owned enterprises. It should be noticed here. Together with the above competitive advantages, China became the first choice for investment. Suppliers would be phased out and lose their competitiveness if they didn’t take a chance to invest in China when it comes to manufacturing plants. Moving from low-income country to hiring skilled labor to manage automated machines country in a way stepping into higher-value manufacturing is a trend in China. China’s government fully identified such a trend, and they did take full advantage of it. Mr. Bingham also responds to the question pointed out by Professor Shen about the role of nearshoring in global trade. Reducing the transportation costs, low production costs and maintaining high quality production can be achieved by bringing manufacturing into the country where companies are located or nearby countries, rather than deploying it in oversea countries. </span>

*Diversification of Supply Chain*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Bingham indicates that single source supplier has been an issue in the supply chain for a long time, and Japanese automakers have been aware of this issue; however, the corresponding practice to the issue haven’t been widely adopted due to the reason that companies focus on lean manufacturing and just-in-time delivery to shave the spending. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is a black swan event for these companies. They put all the eggs in one basket. As a result, many smaller and intermediate-sized companies suffered and weren’t able to survive supply chain disruptions. Responding to the massive upheavals in supply chain across the globe, governments weren’t willing to step in and keep those companies alive with financial support due to the expected huge effort they needed to put in. Moreover, the disruptions made executive managers in the supply chain laid off by companies. These people were replaceable to companies. Mr. Bingham takes semiconductors as an example. Semiconductor chip manufacturing has been concentrated in a relatively small geography, under monotony ownership such as Taiwan companies and factories in China. Companies that heavily rely on Taiwanese suppliers thus fell victim to single-source suppliers. Once the pandemic hit, higher-level supply chain managers make predictions about a sharp decrease in demand. They stop outsourcing the semiconductor chips supplier. Reasonably, these suppliers stop producing chips. However, semiconductor chips are pervasive through the goods in our daily life. Once the demand for automobiles, home appliances, or technology items that can only function with chips bounces back, the supply chain shortage happens. Vulnerabilities of the supply chain thus cut through the industries and were revealed by the pandemic, which led to the policy change, CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 passed by the United States to help out itself in every aspect.

*Trade Policy*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade policy oftentimes doesn’t make everyone a winner. In most cases, some people benefit and lose due to implementing specific trade policies. From an economist's perspective, it is fair to compensate those whose losses are due to trade policy from whose gains are from the procedure. In this case, governments need to manage market intervention. However, government intervention not consistently be implemented solely from the perspective of the economy. National security and other environmental matters and externalities are major concerns. In hindsight, government interventions happened every decade to a greater or lesser degree in tariffs or industrial sectors, including defense, military, energy, and health care. Mr. Bingham predicts that the United States government intervention in capitalist markets will sustain for a while to keep the needs operating differently before the pandemic. He also mentions that these interventions are not likely to expand or accelerate in the United States. He then takes China government as an example that they have been incorporating these interventions into their annual national plans that will keep intervening in specific industries.
    
*Recession: Labeling or not*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to Professor Shen’s question about whether we are in a recession, Mr. Bingham implies that a recession happens as time passes. He then points out the pros and cons of naming a time as the recession. Recession, it is what it is, name it or not, is pointless. However, outside of the economist profession, labeling a circumstance is essential. In this case, shorthand term provides a general sense to outsiders of what’s going on. It guides decision-makers in terms of implementing policies. Another reason that we have taken into consideration when it comes to defining a recession is a trade deficit. Trade deficit refers to a nation consuming more than it produces. This is not unusual in the United States. Still, the recession has been brought into the discussion of the economy's current status because the trade deficit is higher in the first quarter than before. Mr. Bingham states that the United States is currently in a growing recession due to the sign showing that the current unemployment rate is relatively low in history. Mr. Bingham concluded this interview with the point that future urban planners should pay close attention to the business cycle from economists' perspective about public expenditures, taxation, bonds referendum, and inflation.
    
**Response to Specific Issues on this assignment:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing on Mr. Bingham’s statement on trade policy that government market intervention should compensate losers for the gains from the winners. If we look at the COVID-19 Economic Relief, the situation works similarly to the trade policy, except there are no winners in this case. This is to say, the severe health consequences led by COVID-19 made the United States government decide to shut down all businesses. At the same time, the government has to pay for what they did, which is the COVID-19 Economic Relief, the spending of the federal dollar. To further elaborate, the pandemic would have claimed more people's lives if the government didn’t step in this situation. It would be deemed as a government failure because people expect the government to intervene one way or another. To sum up, COVID-19 never makes anyone losers or winners directly if we’re having a pure discussion about the economy. Still, the government does, and it has to do it by shutting down almost all businesses to maintain public health. This would bring us back to the discussion that the different nations have various practices in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, manufacturing in Taiwan and China keeps operating during the pandemic but under a strict COVID screening policy. In this sense, shouldn’t Taiwan or China governments suspend these manufacturers to protect these workers? Unfortunately, they don’t. Because semiconductor chips are essential to national security and economy. However, just like the rest of us, these workers don’t have lower death rates just because they dedicated themselves to the work that is essential to national security. Again, governments decide to put these people's lives at risk for various reasons. Besides, they’re in dilemmas and must always make trade-offs.
    
**Main Take-Away and Recommendations:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest speaker touches upon global issues throughout the interview from the perspective of the economy. I enjoyed the conversation between speakers and learned different terms of the supply chain, such as on-shoring and nearshoring. It is intriguing to know the behind-the-scenes labeling and naming of a specific historical period based on policy-making preferences. Moreover, building a resilient and robust supply chain for the different industries, especially semiconductors, is not solely based on economic matters but also on national security concerns. The first technical memorandum was to listen to the interview about the freight industry, and the discussion with Mr. Bingham was focused more on the global economy but still centers on the global supply chain. Personally, I like the diverse topics, which also align with the core value of this course, partly because I’m not an economy geek, I don’t usually learn about the global economy proactively. However, it is important to be a sponge, learn as much as possible, and be infinite learners. I look forward to the next interview and guest speaker who might also give us in-depth perspectives on the supply chain.
